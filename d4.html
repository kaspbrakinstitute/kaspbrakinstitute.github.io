My son says a “gray man” visits him at night. At first
I thought this was a dream - or an overactive imagination.
Kids make up imaginary friends all the time. But he says the
oddest things. He says the gray man has a huge smile +
huge teeth. He says the gray man knows daddy (me) very
well + he says that we are old friends. When I asked
my son what that meant my son rattled off facts about
me - facts that I have never told him like, stories from
my childhood or conversations I have with my buddies through
texts. Honestly I am just scared. For my son and for me. <br><br>
